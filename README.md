# Raft Implementation
This project is a comprehensive implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm in Python. Raft is designed to provide a robust, fault-tolerant mechanism for managing replicated logs across multiple servers. It ensures that all nodes agree on the values stored in the log, even in the presence of failures.

Features
Leader Election: Implements the leader election process where one node is elected as the leader among the peers.
Log Replication: Ensures that the leader's log entries are replicated across all follower nodes.
Safety: Guarantees safety properties such as election safety, log matching, and state machine safety.
Fault Tolerance: Designed to handle failures gracefully, ensuring system availability and consistency.
Linearizable Reads: Supports linearizable reads from the leader, providing strong consistency guarantees.
Snapshotting: Includes snapshotting functionality to compact the log and improve performance.
